                        it to us by completing our registration form or electing to use one of our services. This

                        <b>Non-Personal Information</b><br>
                        When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may be collected from them
                        including, but not limited to, their browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), operating
                        system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed
                        the site (e.g., google). In addition, we may collect information about visitors' browsing
                        behavior, such as the date and time they visit the Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site
                        that they visit, the amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor
                        returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking pixels to determine the
                        number of Web site visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We do not
                        track any information about visitors once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text
                        files that are stored on visitors computers when they access our Web site) to collect this
                        information. Information collected through cookies may be combined with visitors' personal
                        information. We may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies
                        to visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they
                        may not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on
                        most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the
                        browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard
                        drives.<br>

                        By knowing a little about our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and
                        advertisements, and provide better services. We may use information collected from visitors to
                        our Web site for any of the following purposes: (1) to send visitors information and promotional
                        materials about our company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials from our
                        marketing partners and third parties (such as advertisers on our Web site), (3) to deliver
                        targeted display advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria provided by our
                        advertisers with information collected from our visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our Web
                        site when necessary, (5) to help diagnose problems with our server, (6) to administer our Web
                        site, (7) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to
                        the site), (8) to help us better understand visitors' use of our site, and (9) to protect the
                        security or integrity of our site. (10) to send "push notifications". Non-personal information
                        will be used for purposes of conducting internal reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and
                        providing a greater online experience for our visitors.<br>

                        Push notifications are the messages that mobile apps send to your mobile device or web browser.
                        You may receive notifications for new messages, invites, or other promotional messages. Other
                        message types may be considered for push notifications in the future. You can also control which
                        notifications you currently receive. We send push notifications to your mobile device through
                        services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud
                        Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device
                        operating systems. The privacy policy of the service provider manages access, use and disclosure
                        of your personal data that results from your use of these services. If you have accepted the
                        right to receive push notifications and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can
                        change the settings either on your mobile device or desktop web browser.<br>

                        consultants, other business associates, and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party

                        so by law. We may also disclose information we collect from our site visitors to our marketing
                        and business partners, who may use the information in connection with their business operations,
                        such as to send marketing and other communications to visitors of our site. We may also share,
                        rent, sell, or transfer any personal information provided by our visitors to third parties.
                        During the registration process, and at certain times during any member user session, we may
                        present additional offers from third party service providers. Our third party service providers
                        have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors access these
                        third party sites and review their terms and conditions and privacy policies before
                        "subscribing" to any third party offer. We may also share non-personal information we collect
                        from visitors to our site, such as their browsing behaviors, with third parties. For example, we
                        may tell a third party advertiser that a certain number of people have visited a certain area on
